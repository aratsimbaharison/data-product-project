# data-product-project

This is project is about a shiny application which will help to predict political instability in a given country.

For now, the data used in this project come from the World Bank's World Governance Indicators.

The dependent variable will be the "Political Stability and Absence of Violence/Terrorism: Estimate" designated as by the World Bank as the variable "PV.EST"

The independent variables will include everything else in the World Bank's World Governance Indicators:

- Control of Corruption: Estimate, "CC.EST"
- Government Effectiveness: Estimate, "GE.EST"
- Regulatory Quality: Estimate, "RQ.EST"
- Rule of Law: Estimate, "RL.EST"
- Voice and Accountability: Estimate, "VA.EST"

The first step of this project is to identify the variables that can significantly influence the level of political stability or instablility.

The second step is to build a shiny application with these variables, showing for instance that the level of instability would increase if the level of rule of law decreases.

The third step is to deploy this shiny application on Rstudio's (rpubs).

The fourth and final step is to prepare a presentation in rstudio presentating this shiny application.
